// Jesse decides he wants to play basketball, but he needs equipment to train.
// Write a program that calculates what costs Jesse will have if he starts training, 
// knowing how much is the fee for basketball training for a period of 1 year.
//     Equipment needed: 
// • Basketball sneakers – their price is 40% less than the fee for one year
// • Basketball costume – its price is 20% cheaper than that of sneakers
// • ball – its price is 1 / 4 of the price of the basketball costume
// • Basketball accessories – their price is 1 / 5 of the price of the ball


// input: output:   Explanations:
// 365	  811.76 	Price of training per year: 365
//                  Price of basketball sneakers: 365 – 40 % = 219
//                  Price per basketball costume: 219 – 20 % = 175.20
//                  Price of ball: 1 / 4 from 175.20 = 43.80
//                  Price of basketball accessories: 1 / 5 from 43.80 = 8.76
//                  Total price for the equipment: 365 + 219 + 175.20 + 43.80 + 8.76 = 811.76
