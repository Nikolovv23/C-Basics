// Climbers from all over Bulgaria gather in groups and mark the next peaks to climb. Depending on the size of the group, the climbers will climb different peaks.
// ⦁ Group of up to 5 people - climb Musala
// ⦁ Group of 6 to 12 people - climb Mont Blanc
// ⦁ Group of 13 to 25 people - climb Kilimanjaro
// ⦁ Group of 26 to 40 people - climb K2
// ⦁ A group of 41 or more people - climb Everest
// Write a program that calculates the percentage of climbers climbing each peak.

// Entrance
// A series of numbers are read from the console, each on a separate line:
// ⦁ In the first row - the number of groups of climbers - an integer in the range [1 ... 1000]
// ⦁ For each group on a separate line - the number of people in the group - an integer in the range [1 ... 1000]

// Exit
// Print 5 lines on the console, each containing a percentage between 0.00% and 100.00% to the second digit after the decimal point.
// ⦁ First row - the percentage of climbing Musala
// ⦁ Second row - the percentage of climbers Mont Blanc
// ⦁ Third row - the percentage of climbing Kilimanjaro
// ⦁ Fourth row - the percentage of climbers K2
// ⦁ Fifth row - the percentage of climbing Everest
