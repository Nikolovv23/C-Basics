// Grigor Dimitrov is a tennis player whose next goal is to rise in the world rankings in men's tennis.
// During the year Grisho participates in a number of tournaments, receiving points for each tournament, which depend on the position in which he 
// finished in the tournament. There are three options for completing a tournament:
// ⦁ W - if the winner receives 2000 points
// ⦁ F - if he is a finalist he receives 1200 points
// ⦁ SF - if he is a semifinalist he gets 720 points
// Write a program that calculates how many points Grigor will have after playing all the tournaments, knowing how many points the season starts with. 
// Also calculate how many points he averages on all tournaments played and what percentage of tournaments he has won.

// Entrance
// Two lines are read from the console first:
// ⦁ Number of tournaments in which he participated - integer in the interval [1… 20]
// ⦁ Initial number of points in the rankings - an integer in the range [1 ... 4000]
// A separate line is read for each tournament:
// ⦁ Reached the stage of the tournament - text - "W", "F" or "SF"

// Exit
// Three lines are printed in the following format:
// ⦁ "Final points: {number of points after tournaments played}"
// ⦁ "Average points: {average points earned per tournament}"
// ⦁ "{percentage of tournaments won}%"
// The middle points should be rounded down to the nearest whole number, and the percentage should be formatted to the second digit after the decimal point.
