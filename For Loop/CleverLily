// Lily is already N years old. She receives a gift for each of her birthdays.
// ⦁ For odd birthdays (1, 3, 5 ... n) receives toys.
// ⦁ For even birthdays (2, 4, 6 ... n) receives money.
// For the second birthday he receives BGN 10.00, as the amount increases by BGN 10.00, for each subsequent even birthday (2 -> 10, 4 -> 20, 6 -> 30 ... etc.). 
// Over the years, Lily has secretly saved money. Lily's brother, in the years she receives money, takes BGN 1.00 from them. 
// Lily sold the toys received over the years, each for P levs and added the amount to the money saved. 
// With the money she wanted to buy a washing machine for X leva. Write a program to calculate how much money she has raised and whether she has enough to buy a washing
// machine.

// Entrance
// The program reads 3 numbers entered by the user in separate lines:
// ⦁ Lily's age - an integer in the range [1 ... 77]
// ⦁ The price of the washing machine - a number in the range [1.00 ... 10 000.00]
// ⦁ Unit price of a toy - an integer in the range [0 ... 40]

// Exit
// Print one line on the console:
// ⦁ If Lily's money is enough:
// Yes "Yes! {N}" - where N is the cash balance after purchase
// ⦁ If the money is not enough:
// "" No! {M} "- where M is the amount that is not enough
// The numbers N and M must be formatted to the second decimal place.

// Input
// 10
// 170.00
// 6
