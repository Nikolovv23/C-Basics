// Tony and his friends love to go fishing and are so passionate about fishing that they decide to go fishing by boat. 
// The price for renting a boat depends on the season and the number of fishermen:
// Depending on the season:
// ⦁ The price for renting the ship in the spring is 3000 BGN;
// ⦁ The price for renting the ship in summer and autumn is 4200 BGN;
// ⦁ The price for renting the ship in winter is 2600 BGN.
// Depending on the number of groups there is a different discount:
// ⦁ If the group is up to 6 people inclusive - 10% discount;
// ⦁ If the group is from 7 to 11 people inclusive - discount of 15%;
// ⦁ If the group is from 12 upwards - 25% discount.
// Fishermen enjoy an additional 5% discount if they are an even number, unless it is autumn - then they do not have an additional discount,
// which is accrued after deducting the discount according to the above criteria.
// Write a program to calculate whether fishermen will raise enough money.

// Entrance
// Three lines are read from the console:
// ⦁ Group budget - integer;
// ⦁ Season - text: "Spring", "Summer", "Autumn" or "Winter";
// ⦁ Number of fishermen - integer.

// Input
// 3000
// Summer
// 11

// Exit
// Print the following on the console:
// ⦁ If the budget is sufficient:
// "Yes! You have {the rest of the money} left."
// ⦁ If the budget is NOT sufficient:
// "Not enough money! You need {the amount that is not enough} leva."
// Amounts must be formatted to two decimal places.
