// A student must go to the exam at a certain time (for example, at 9:30). He comes to the examination hall at a certain time of arrival (for example 9:40).
// It is considered that the student arrived on time if he arrived at the time of the exam or up to half an hour before. 
// If he arrived more than 30 minutes earlier, he was early. If he came after the exam time, he was late. 
// Write a program that reads exam time and arrival time and records whether the student arrived on time, was early or late, and by how many hours or 
// minutes was early or late.

// Entrance
// The console reads 4 integers (one per line) entered by the user:
// ⦁ The first line contains the exam time - an integer from 0 to 23;
// ⦁ The second line contains a minute of the exam - an integer from 0 to 59;
// ⦁ The third line contains the time of arrival - an integer from 0 to 23;
// ⦁ The fourth line contains the minute of arrival - an integer from 0 to 59.

// Exit
// On the first line print:
// ⦁ "Late" if the student arrives later than the exam time;
// ⦁ "On time", if the student arrives exactly at the time of the exam or up to 30 minutes earlier;
// "" Early "if the student arrives more than 30 minutes before the exam time.
// If the student arrives at least one minute apart from the exam time, print on the following line:
// ⦁ "mm minutes before the start" for arriving earlier by less than an hour;
// "" Hh: mm hours before the start "for 1 hour or more early. Always print the minutes in 2 digits, for example "1:05";
// "" Mm minutes after the start "for a delay of less than an hour;
// "" Hh: mm hours after the start "for a delay of 1 hour or more. Always print the minutes with 2 digits, for example "1:03".

// Input
// 9
// 30
// 9
// 50
