// Ivan decided to break the world record in long-distance swimming. On the console is entered the record in seconds that Ivan has to improve,
// the distance in meters he has to swim and the time in seconds for which he swims a distance of 1 m. Write a program that calculates whether 
// he has coped with the task, taking into account that: the resistance of the water slows it down every 15 meters by 12.5 seconds. When calculating 
// how many times Ivancho will slow down as a result of the resistance of the water, the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.
// To calculate the time in seconds for which Ivan will swim the distance and difference from the World Record. 
// Input - From the console read 3 lines:
// 1.The record in seconds – a real number in the range [0.00 ... 100000.00]
// 2.The distance in meters – a real number in the range [0.00 ... 100000.00]
// 3.The time in seconds for which a distance of 1 m floats - a real number in the range [0.00 ... 1000.00]
// Output:
// • If Ivan has broken the World Record (his time is less than the record) we print:
// o   " Yes, he succeeded! The new world record is (Ivan's time} seconds."
// • If he has NOT improved the record (his time is greater than or equal to the record) we print:
// o   "No, he failed! He was (short seconds} seconds slower."
// The result must be formatted to two decimal places.
// 
// Examples:
