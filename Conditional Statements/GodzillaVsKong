//Filming for Godzilla vs. Kong has begun. Screenwriter Adam Wingard asks you to write a program to calculate whether the funds are enough to shoot the film. 
//Photos will require a certain number of extras, clothing for each extraist and decor.
//It is known that:
//• The set for the film is worth 10% of the budget. 
//• With more than 150 extras, there is a discount on clothing worth 10%.
//Input - 3 lines:
//Budget for the film – a real number in the range [1.00 ... 1000000.00]
//Number of extras – integer in the range [1 ... 500]
//Price for clothing of an extra – a real number in the range[1.00... 1000.00]
//Output - Two lines should be printed on the console:
//• If the money for the decor and clothes is more than budget:
//o   "Not enough money!"
//"Wingard needs leva more."
//• If the money for the decor and clothes is less than or equal to the budget:
//o   "Action!"
//o "Wingard starts filming with {the rest of the money} leva left."
//The result must be formatted to two decimal places.
