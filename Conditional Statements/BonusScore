//An integer is given – the initial number of points. Bonus points are accrued on it according to the rules described below. 
//Write a program that calculates the bonus points that the number receives and the total number of points (the number + bonus).
//• If the number is up to 100 inclusive, the bonus points are 5.
//• If the number is greater than 100, the bonus points are 20% of the number.
//• If the number is greater than 1000, the bonus points are 10% of the number.
//• Additional bonus points (accruing separately from the previous ones):
//o For an even number  + 1 point.
//o For a number that ends in 5 + 2 points.
