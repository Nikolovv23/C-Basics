//During your lunch break, you want to watch an episode of your favorite series. Your task is to write a program with which you will find out if you have 
//enough time to watch the episode. During the break, you set aside time for lunch and time for relaxation. The lunch time will be 1/8 of the rest time,
//and the rest time will be 1/4 of the rest time. 
//Input - From the console read 3 lines:
//1.Series Name – Text
//2. Episode duration – an integer in the range [10... 90]
//3.Rest duration – an integer in the range [10... 120]
//Output - Write one line on the console:
//• If the time is enough to watch the episode: 
//"You have enough time to watch and left with minutes free time."
//• If your time is not enough:
//"You don't have enough time to watch, you need more minutes."
//Round the time to the nearest integer upwards.

//Examples:
//input output 
//Game of Thrones        You have enough time to watch Game of Thrones and left with 0 minutes free time.
//60
//96

//input                  output
//Teen Wolf              You don't have enough time to watch Teen Wolf, you need 11 more minutes.
//48
//60
