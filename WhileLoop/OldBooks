// Ani goes to her hometown after a very long period abroad. On her way home, she sees her grandmother's old library and remembers her favorite book. 
// Help Annie by writing a program in which she enters the book (text) she is looking for. Until Annie finds her favorite book or checks all the books in the library, 
// the program must read each time on a new line the name of each subsequent book (text) that she checks. The books in the library are gone as soon as you receive the text
// "No More Books".
// ⦁ If he does not find the book he is looking for, print it in two lines:
// ⦁ "The book you search is not here!"
// ⦁ "You checked {number} books."
// ⦁ If he finds his book, one line is printed:
// ⦁ "You checked {number} books and found it."
