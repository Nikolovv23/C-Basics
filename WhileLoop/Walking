// Gabby wants to start a healthy lifestyle and has set a goal of walking 10,000 steps every day. 
// However, some days she is very tired from work and will want to go home before she achieves her goal. 
// Write a program that reads from the console how many steps it takes each time it goes out during the day and when it achieves its goal of writing
// "Goal reached! Good job!" and how many more steps she took "{the difference between the steps} steps over the goal!"
// If she wants to go home before that, she will enter the "Going home" command and enter the steps she took while returning home. 
// Then, if it fails to achieve its goal, the console should read: "{step difference} more steps to reach goal."
