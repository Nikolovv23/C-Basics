// On each line you will receive the amount you need to deposit in the account until you receive the command "NoMoreMoney". 
// For each amount received, the console must display "Increase:" + the amount and add it to the account. If you get a number less than 0, "Invalid operation!" 
// Must be displayed on the console. and the program ends. 
// When the program ends, "Total:" must be printed + the total amount in the account formatted to the second decimal place.
