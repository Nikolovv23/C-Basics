// You are invited to the 30th birthday, when the birthday boy eats a huge cake. However, he does not know how many pieces his guests can take from her. 
// Your task is to write a program that calculates the number of pieces that guests have taken before it ends. You will get the dimensions of the 
// cake (width and length - integers and then on each line, until you receive the command "STOP" or until the cake is finished, the number of 
// pieces that guests take from it. Each piece of cake is 1x1 cm .
// Print one of the following lines on the console:
// "{Number of pieces} pieces are left." - if you reach STOP and the pieces of cake are not finished;
// "No more cake left! You need {number of missing pieces} pieces more."
