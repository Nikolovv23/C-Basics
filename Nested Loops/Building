// Write a program that displays the numbers of the rooms in a building (in descending order) on the console, provided that the following conditions are met:
// ⦁ There are only offices on each even floor;
// ⦁ There are only apartments on each odd floor;
// ⦁ Each apartment is denoted as follows: A {floor number} {apartment number}, apartment numbers start from 0;
// ⦁ Each office is denoted as follows: О {floor number} {office number}, office numbers also start from 0;
// ⦁ There are always apartments on the top floor and they are bigger than the others, so their number says 'L' instead of 'A'. 
// If there is only one floor, there are only large apartments!
// Two integers are read from the console - the number of floors and the number of rooms per floor.
