// Annie loves to travel and wants to visit several different destinations this year. When she chooses a destination, she will decide how much money 
// she will need to get there, and she will start saving. When she has saved enough, she will be able to travel.
// The destination and the minimum budget (decimal number) that will be needed for the trip will be read from the console each time.
// Then a few sums (decimal numbers) will be read, which Annie saves by working and when she manages to collect enough for the trip,
// she will leave, and the console should say: "Going to {destination}!"
// When she has visited all the destinations she wants, instead of a destination she will enter "End" and the program will end.
