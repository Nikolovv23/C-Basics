// Your task is to write a program that calculates the percentage of tickets for each type of ticket sold: student (student), standard (standard) and child (kid),
// for all screenings. You also need to calculate what percentage of the hall is filled for each screening.

// Input
// The input is a series of integers and text:
// ⦁ On the first line until you receive the command "Finish" - movie name - text
// ⦁ In the second row - the free seats in the hall for each screening - integer [1… 100]
// ⦁ For each film, one line is read until the vacancies in the hall are exhausted or until the "End" command is received:
// ⦁ Type of ticket purchased - text ("student", "standard", "kid")

// Output
// The following lines must be printed on the console:
// ⦁ After each film, print what percentage of the cinema is full
// "{movie name} - {percentage of hall full}% full."
// ⦁ When receiving the "Finish" command, print four lines:
// ⦁ "Total tickets: {total number of tickets purchased for all films}"
//  "{Percentage of student tickets}% student tickets."
// ⦁ "{percentage of standard tickets}% standard tickets."
//  "{Percentage of children's tickets}% kids tickets."
